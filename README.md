# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Overview Includes combining two Repos

> This project will be enhancing the `Basic-Portfolio` repo with a mobile-responsive layout.

## Instructions (Bootstrap)

1.	Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create `index.html`, `portfolio.html`, and `contact.html` files.

2.	Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

•	A navbar
•	A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)
    > eg. On xs and sm screens, each section should take up the entire grid. On m and larger screens, each section should take up 2/3 of the grid and the sidebar should take up 1/3 of the grid
•	Responsive images

BONUS Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-solumns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)
1.	Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
2.	Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
